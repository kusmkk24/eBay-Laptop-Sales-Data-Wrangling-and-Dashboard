# eBay Laptop Sales Data Wrangling and Dashboard

This individual project involved cleaning and analyzing a dataset of over 7,000 eBay laptop sales records. Using Python and Pandas, I wrangled and merged multiple data sources, handled missing values, and prepared the data for visualization. I then built an interactive Streamlit dashboard featuring:

* **Dynamic filtering:** Users could explore the data with customizable input widgets.
* **Visualizations:** Streamlit and Plotly Express charts highlighted key sales attributes, such as price trends and brand performance.
* **Business insights:** Each chart included written analyses tailored for decision-making.
  
The final deliverables included a polished dataset and a professional dashboard designed to guide strategic decisions in e-commerce.
